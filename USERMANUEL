To play single player simply click "Create" when you enter the lobby. To play multiplayer have one player click "Create" after entering their name and then the next player click join. To play the game collect as many pieces of candy as you can before your health bar runs out from running into too many attack lights. At the end you will have an option to rematch or disconnect. If you are the player who chose to click "Create" wait until the other player has finished playing before selecting either option. Then after any rematch simply select "Join" as the server and network has already been created.

To move in the game use the arrow keys to move around the world, space bar to jump, '"' key to fly, and '"' key and forward to slide forward. If on ledge select "k" to pull yourself up or "l" to fall.
