This project we struggled with time management and ended up having to use our slip days which was not expected. We were able to complete this project with these slip days however and submit it. We utilized the resources around us as much as possible and were able to get the network working using the tutorial among other internet sources. We were not able to implement the timer and a final end screen showing the scores as we would have liked, but the game still has an end condition of the players hitting too many lights and dying. We simply struggled with time management and testing of the project as none of us went into this project knowing the best way to test and debug multiplayer networking games. Overall I think we did well and completed all of the requirements of this project.
